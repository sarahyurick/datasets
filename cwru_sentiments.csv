11,"All-around good guy, really knowledgeable about the topic, and a good lecturer to boot. Not your usual psych class (t's not just a multiple choice vocab test like most psych classes tend to be), so be prepared for that. As long as you review the class outlines and pay attention in class you should be prepared for the exams. Do the extra credit.",0.2222222222222222

13,"Definitely an old-school professor, but his lectures are really interesting. He has a lot of professional experience that he draws on and you learn a lot about methods of therapy. Review his outlines he sends out and you'll be fine; just make sure to start on the scavenger hunt early.",0.26944444444444443
14,"There are 100 total points in this class, and an A drops to B at 91. You have to show up to random lectures to get activity sheets to get 10 points so skipping isn't smart. Then his tests have little relevance to the information he teaches so it's basically a crap shoot of information. then 30 point end project. So there is minimal room for error",-0.22886904761904767
15,"Besides teaching in class, he is also a psychologist and I can see he's very passionate in teaching ways to approach clients. The class has one midterm and a final. The midterm was doable if you study his materials (take good notes). he allowed extra credit for turning mc in each class and those will be on  the final!! so the final is not too bad..",-0.009285714285714262
16,"literally one of the worst professors ever. Lectures are littered with frivolous information. Unfortunately, predicting what will appear on the two exams seems almost impossible. This professor killed my enthusiasm in the subject area because of his inability to communicate the important information. This class makes a joke of the psychology major.",-0.29583333333333334
17,"He was very interested in the material, but never got the class interested. There was one large project and three test, so it was not a whole lot of work. Each test had a few tricks from the book, but it was mostly from his lectures. He took on the characters of the people in class ie. Jung, Adler, Freud...It was interesting/strange.",0.16488095238095238

She uses good examples, which is important.  Her office hours are also extremely helpful and she doesn't act like she's too busy for you. Definitely my favorite prof in BME; and I'm not in imaging!",0.25166666666666665

29,Took this class during May Term and basically everyday we learned a week's worth of material every day. The material is not too difficult but it is just a lot in a short amount of time. Kuemerle is a nice lecturer and is very kind. She is very receptive to answering questions both inside and outside of class.,0.1475

33,"Absolute waste of time. Extremely forgetful in posting promised assignments and resources. She lectures for herself and not her students.

However, she always makes herself available to answer questions or provide help to students. Additionally, she was super receptive to questions about grading, and has given me points back.",0.08833333333333333
38,"Memorize her powerpoints--there's like 300+ slides to memorize per exam and it's awful awful awful watching the lectures because she just drones on for over an hour. Everything she says comes verbatim off the powerpoints--and funny thing about her powerpoints, a lot of it is verbatim off of Wikipedia.",-0.6875
39,"The worst class I have taken while at Case Western.  The professor reads directly off the slides and her lectures drag on, halfway through the semester less than 10% of the class was paying attention. Over 400 slides to MEMORIZE per test.  Tests were extremely specific, picking out minor unneeded details as test questions. Not worth your time.",-0.17083333333333334
40,"She is super approachable and nice in e-mails -- it's really easy to ask for help if you need it or if you don't understand something. In lectures, she will talk about what's always on the NEXT slide instead of the slide she's currently presenting which is frustrating... but all test material comes from her PowerPoints. Memorize them well ;)   ",0.17380952380952383
41,Dr. Kuemerle is the best for BIOL 216L in the summer! I literally have a 100% in the course. She's extremely helpful and gives useful inputs on how to design good posters and write excellent papers. She's also fun to chat with in a small class and is a really cool professor. Highly recommend taking this for a good lab experience.,0.4135
42,Kuemerle is a great professor in lecture. She is very enthusiastic and explains things really well. MEMORIZE her power points to the last picture and go to SI sessions.

You can do well in the course if you just study off the powerpoints and old tests she puts on Blackboard.",0.18333333333333335

Very manageable class if you put in the work to stay on top of content.",0.3125

66,"Very nice and very clear when speaking. Notes online are very helpful and apply directly to the homework (every week, very straightforward). Exams were reminiscent of HWs.

10346,She is a horrible lecturer. Disorganized and rude. She does not answer questions and expects you to be as knowledgeable about pirates as she is. She is extremely unprofessional and does not dress appropriately. This is the worst class I have ever taken.,-0.385
10347,Super hard grader. Pretty annoying.,-0.12708333333333335
10348,"The lectures were disorganized. Class was easy. You just signed your name for attendance. Most people slept or did other work. Her Teaching Assistants did the grading and discussion, the one I had was arrogant. I hated this class, because of the TA, but Prof. Weiss was ok.",0.08166666666666667
10349,"Great teacher, knows the subject well, makes the course material very interesting. She is very lenient and kind and is an overall great professor. I highly recommend her.",0.43666666666666676
10350,"This class sucked badly, lots of work and it was painful to sit though the daily discussions",-0.4666666666666666
10351,"This was a great class.  My section was scheduled to meet once a week for 2.5 hrs and the class was discussion-based.  Thus, in filling that 2.5 hour block, the class did often resemble a SAGES class.  Very interesting readings though and Weiss is more than eager to help.  If you have any interest in 'France and Islam,' I heartily recommend it.",0.65
10352,Nice professor and a fair grader.  Class was run too much like a SAGES class for my liking.  Sometimes has difficulty controlling the discussions which usually resulted in off-topic and unfounded statements by class members.  A lot of theoretical and philisophical discussions that seemed out of place considering it was a history class.  Nice lady.,0.3083333333333333
10353,"BECOME ONE OF HER FAVORITES. She can be rough on you, especially if you dont do the readings and write a paper on it. SHE WILL KNOW -- NO BS WITH HER. Also she's a much rougher grader than the writing instructor. Slavery is not one of the most interesting topics ever so hope you get a really fun group of kids. Nice lady overall, though.",0.25
10354,She encouraged us to be interested in the material and was very willing to try new teaching techniques.  Very nice and understanding!,0.4215909090909091

10366,"Professor Belu is a good guy that just wants you to learn the material, and have everyone get A's. An A is an 85 and its open book open note tests, so its fairly easy to do well. 90% of kids in my class got A's. Material gets kind of difficult towards end, but the final project helps you understand",0.17916666666666664
