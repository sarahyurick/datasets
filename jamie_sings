I'm breaking my mother's heart
The longer I stand looking at you
The more I hear it splinter and crack
From 90 miles away

I'm breaking my mother's heart
The JCC of Spring Valley is shaking
And crumbling to the ground
And my grandfather's rolling, rolling in his grave

If you had a tattoo, that wouldn't matter
If you had a shaved head, that would be cool
If you came from Spain or Japan or the back of a van
Just as long as you're not from Hebrew school
I'd say, now I'm getting somewhere
I'm finally breaking through
I'd say, hey, hey, Shiksa Goddess
I've been waiting for someone like you

I've been wading through Danica Schwartz
And Erica Weiss
And the Handleman twins
I've been wading through Heather Greenblatt
Annie Mincus, Karen Pincus, and Lisa Katz
And Stacy Rosen and Ellen Kaplan and Julie Silber and Janie Stein
I've had Shabbas dinners on Friday nights
With every Shapiro in Washington Heights

But the minute I first met you
I could barely catch my breath
I've been standing for days with a phone in my hand
Like an idiot scared to death
I've been wandering through the desert
I've been beaten, I've been hit
My people have suffered for thousands of years
And I don't give a shit

If you had a pierced tongue, that wouldn't matter
If you once were in jail or you once were a man
If your mother and your brother had relations with each other
And your father was connected to the Gotti clan
I'd say, "Well, nobody's perfect"
It's tragic but it's true
I'd say, hey, hey, Shiksa Goddess
I've been waiting for someone like you

Breaking the circle
You...
Taking the light
You...
You are the story I should write
I have to write...

If you drove an RV, that wouldn't matter
If you like to drink blood - I think it's cute
If you've got a powerful connection to your firearm collection
I say, "Draw a bead and shoot"
I'm your Hebrew slave at your service
Just tell me what to do
I'd say, hey, hey, hey, hey
I've been waiting for someone...
I've been praying for someone...
I think that I could be in love with someone
Like you

Did I just hear an alarm start ringing?
Did I see sirens go flying past?
Though I don't know what tomorrow's bringing
I've got a singular impression things are moving too fast

I'm gliding smooth as a figure skater
I'm riding hot as a rocket blast -
I just expected it ten years later
I've got a singular impression things are moving too fast

And you say, "Oh, no
Step on the brakes
Do whatever it takes
But stop this train!
Slow, slow! The light's turning red!"
But I say: No! No!
Whatever I do
I barrel on through
And I don't complain
No matter what I try, I'm flyin' full speed ahead!

I'm never worried to walk the wire
I won't do anything just "half-assed,"
But with the stakes getting somewhat higher
I've got a singular impression that things are moving too fast

I found a woman I love
And I found an agent who loves me -
Things might get bumpy, but

Some people analyze ev'ry detail
Some people stall when they can't see the trail
Some people freeze out of fear that they'll fail
But I keep rollin' on

Some people can't find success with their art
Some people never feel love in their heart
Some people can't tell the two things apart
But I keep rollin' on

Oh, oh - maybe I can't follow through
But oh, oh - what else am I s'pposed to do?

I dreamed of writing like the high and mighty -
Now I'm the subject of a bidding war!
I met my personal Aphrodite -
I'm doing things I never dreamed of before!

We start to take the next step together -
Found an apartment on Seventy-Third!
The Atlantic Monthly's printing my first chapter -
Two thousand bucks without rewriting one word!

I left Columbia and I don't regret it -
I wrote a book and Sonny Mehta read it!
My heart's been stolen!
My ego's swollen!
I just keep rollin' along!

And I think, "Well, well, what else is in store?
Got all this and more
Before twenty-four!"
It's hard not to be sure I'm spinning out of control!
Out of control!

I'm feeling panicked and rushed and hurried!
I'm feeling outmaneuvered and outclassed
But I'm so happy I can't get worried
About this singular impression -
I've got a singular impression things are moving too fast!

Schmuel would work till half-past ten at his tailor shop in Klimovich
Get up at dawn and start again with the hems and pins and twist
Forty-one years had come and gone at his tailor shop in Klimovich
Watching the winters soldier on, there was one thing Schmuel missed

"If I only had time," old Schmuel said
"I would build the dress that's in my head
A dress to fire
The mad desire
Of girls from here to Minsk
But I have no more hours left to sew"
Then the clock upon the wall began to glow...

And the clock said:
"Na na na na, na na na
Oh Schmuel, you'll get to be happy!
Na na na na, na na na
I give you unlimited time!
Na na na na, na na na
So Schmuel, go sew and be happy!"
But Schmuel said
"No, no, it's not my lot
I've gotta make do with the time I've got"

"Oh, look at the time"

Schmuel was done at half-past ten and he said "Good night, old Klimovich"
Put on his coat to go, but then the clock cried, "Wait! Not yet!
Even though you're not wise or rich
You're the finest man in Klimovich
Listen up, Schmuel
Make one stitch and you'll see what you get"

But Schmuel said
"Clock, it's much too late
I'm at peace with life
I accept my fate..."
But the clock said
"Schmuel! One stitch and you will
Unlock the dreams you've lost!"
So Schmuel, with reluctance, took his thread
He pulled a bolt of velvet and said
"I should take out my teeth and go to bed
I'm sitting her with talking clocks instead!"

And the clock said:
"Na na na na, na na na
Oh Schmuel, you'll get to be happy!
Na na na na, na na na,
I give you unlimited time
Na na na na, na na na
Just do it and you can be happy!"

So Schmuel put the thread through the needle's eye
And the moon stared down from a starless sky
And he pushed the thread through the velvet black
And he looked, and the clock was turning,
back

So he grabbed his shears and he cut some lace
As the hands reversed on the old clock's face
And his fingers flew and the fabric swirled
It was nine-fifteen all around the world

Every cut and stitch was a perfect fit
As if God Himself were controlling it!
And Schmuel cried through a rush of tears
"Take me back! Take me back all forty-one years!"

And on it went down that silent street
Till Schmuel's dress was at last complete
And he stretched his arms
And he closed his eyes
And the morning sun finally started to rise

And the dress he made on that endless night
Was a dress that would make any soul take flight
Not a swatch, not a skein had gone to waste
Every ribbon and button ideally placed
And swen into the seams were forty-one seasons of dreams
Dreams that you could feel
Coming real

And that very dress, so the papers swore
Was the dress a girl in Odessa wore
On the day she promised forevermore
To love a young man named Schmuel
Who only one day before
Had knocked at her kitchen door

Plenty have hoped and dreamed and prayed
But they can't get out of Klimovich
If Schmuel had been a cute goyishe maid
He'd've looked a lot like you
Maybe it's just that you're afraid to go out on to a limb-ovich
Maybe your heart's completely swayed
But your head can't follow through

But shouldn't I want the world to see
The brilliant girl who inspires me?
Don't you think that now's a good time to be
The ambitious freak you are?
Say goodbye to wiping ashtrays at the bar
Say hello to Cathy Hiatt, big-time star!
'Cause I say:
Na na na na na na na na
Cathy, you get to be happy!
Na na na na na na na
I give you unlimited time!
Na na na na na na na
Stop temping and go and be happy!

Here's a headshot guy and a new BackStage
Where you're right for something on every page
Take a breath
Take a step
Take a chance

Take your time
Have I mentioned today
How lucky I am
To be in love with you?!

No, that one's Jerry Seinfeld
That one's John Lennon there
No, the Dakota—
The San Remo is up a few blocks
Have you been inside the museum?
We should go
Meet the dinosaurs

Will you share your life with me
For the next ten minutes?
For the next ten minutes:
We can handle that
We could watch the waves
We could watch the sky
Or just sit and wait
As the time ticks by
And if we make it ‘til then
Can I ask you again
For another ten?

And if you in turn agree
To the next ten minutes
And the next ten minutes
‘Til the morning comes
Then just holding you
Might compel me to
Ask you for more
There are so many lives I want to share with you—
I will never be complete until "I do"



Will you share your life with me
For the next ten lifetimes?
For a million summers


Til the world explodes
‘Til there's no one left
Who has ever known us apart!

There are so many dreams I need to see
With you
I will never be complete—
I will never change the world
Until "I do"

I do

I do

Everyone tells you that the minute you get married
Every other woman in the world
Suddenly finds you attractive
Well, that's not true
It only affects the kind of women
You always wanted to sleep with
But they wouldn't give you the time of day before
And now they're banging down your door
And falling to their knees
At least that's what it feels like because you
Can
Not
Touch
Them
In fact, you can't even look at them
Close your eyes, close your eyes, close your eyes
Except you're sitting there
Eating your corned beef sandwich
And all of a sudden, this pair of breasts walks by
And smiles at you
And you're like "That's not fair!"
And in a perfect world
A miracle would happen
And every other girl would fly away
And it'd be me and Cathy
And nothing else would matter
But it's fine, it's fine, it's fine
I mean, I'm happy
And I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine
It's not a problem, just a challenge
It's a challenge to resist
Temptation
And I have to say that
What exacerbates the problem
Is I'm at these parties
I'm the center of attention
I'm the grand fromage
And here she comes:
"Let's get a cup of coffee
Will you look at my manuscript?"
And I'm showing her my left hand
I'm gesticulating with my left hand
And then WHOOMP! There's Cathy!
'Cause she knows
(They always know)
And there's that really awkward moment
Where I try to show I wasn't encouraging this
(Though of course I sort of was)
And I don't want to look whipped in front of this woman
Which is dumb - I shouldn't care what she thinks
Since I can't fuck her anyway!
And in a perfect world
A miracle would happen
And every girl would look like Mister Ed
And it'd be me and Cathy
And nothing else would matter
But it's fine, it's fine, it's fine
You know I love her
And it's fine, it's fine, it's fine
It's what I wanted
And I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine!
It's not a problem, just a challenge
It's a challenge to resist
Temptation

I'll be there soon, Cathy
I'll finish up this chapter and be out the door
I swear I'll be there soon, Cathy
Don't give up on me yet
I am so proud of you, baby
You're doing what you never got to do before
And I will be there, ripe and crawling
If fricking Random House stops calling
Don't lose faith
Don't get down
Don't despair
I'll be there
And in a perfect world
A miracle would happen
And that day would finally be here
And it'd be me and you
Riding it together
And the things we do
Goin' like we planned
We're gonna make it through
And nothing else will matter
We'll be fine, we're fine
We're fine, we're fine, we're fine
I'll be there soon, Cathy
I swear I will

There are people
And they are publishing my book
And there's a party
That they are throwing
And while you've made it very clear that you're not going
I will be going
And that's done

But what's it really about?
Is it really about a party, Cathy?
Can we please for a minute
Stop blaming and say what you feel?
Is it just that you're disappointed
To be going again to Ohio?
Did you think this would all be much easier
Than it's turned out to be?
Well, then talk to me, Cathy
Talk to me

If I didn't believe in you
We'd never have gotten this far
If I didn't believe in you
And all of the ten thousand women you are
If I didn't think you could do
Anything you ever wanted to
If I wasn't certain that you'd come through somehow
The fact of the matter is, Cathy
I wouldn't be standing here now

If I didn't believe in you
We wouldn't be having this fight
If I didn't believe in you
I'd walk out the door and say, "Cathy, you're right."
But I never could let that go
Knowing the things about you I know –
Things, when I met you four years ago, I knew
It never took much convincing
To make me believe in you

Don't we get to be happy, Cathy?
At some point down the line
Don't we get to relax
Without some new tsuris
To push me yet further from you?
If I'm cheering on your side, Cathy
Why can't you support mine?
Why do I have to feel
I committed some felony
Doing what I always swore I would do?

I don't want you to hurt
I don't want you to sink
But you know what I think?
I think you'll be fine!
Just hang on and you'll see –
But don't make me wait 'til you do
To be happy with you –
Will you listen to me?
No one can give you courage
No one can thicken your skin
I will not fail so you can be comfortable, Cathy
I will not lose because you can't win

If I didn't believe in you
Then here's where the travelogue ends
If I didn't believe in you
I couldn't have stood before all of our friends
And said, "This is the life I choose –
This is the thing I can't bear to lose
Trip us or trap us, but we refuse to fall."
That's what I thought we agreed on, Cathy
If I hadn't believed in you
I wouldn't have loved you at all

Now why don't you put on your dress and we'll go, okay? Cathy? Can we do that, please? Please?

Hey, kid– good morning–
You look like an angel
I don't remember when we fell asleep
We should get up, kid–
Cathy is waiting…

Look at us, lying here
Dreaming, pretending
I made a promise and I took a vow
I wrote a story
And we changed the ending –
Cathy, just look at me now!

Hold on, facts are facts –
Just relax, lay low
All right, the panic recedes:
Nobody needs to know

Put on my armor –
I'm off to Ohio
Back into battle till I don't know when
Swearing to her that I
Never was with you
And praying I'll hold you again

Hold on, clip these wings –
Things get out of hand
All right, it's over, it's done –
No one will understand
No one will understand…

We build a treehouse
I keep it from shaking –
Little more glue ev'ry time that it breaks
Perfectly balanced
And then I start making
Conscious, deliberate mistakes

All that I ask for
Is one little corner –
One private room at the back of my heart
Tell her I found one
She sends out battalions
To claim it and blow it apart

I grip and she grips
And faster we're sliding
Sliding and spilling, and what can I do?
Come back to bed, kid –
Take me inside you –
I promise I won't lie to you

Hold on, don't cry yet –
I won't let you go
All right – the panic recedes;
All right – everyone bleeds;
All right – I get what I need
And nobody needs
To know
Nobody needs to know…

And since I have to be in love with someone
Since I need to be in love with someone
Maybe I could be in love with someone
Like you…

I called Elise to help me pack my bags
I went downtown and closed the bank account
It's not about another shrink
It's not about another compromise
I'm not the only one who's hurting here
I don't know what the Hell is left to do
You never saw how far the crack had opened
You never knew I had run out of rope and

I could never rescue you
All you ever wanted
But I could never rescue you
No matter how I tried
All I could do was love you hard
And let you go

No matter how I tried
All I could do was love you
God, I loved you so
So we could fight
Or we could wait
Or I could go...

You never noticed how
The wind had changed
I didn't see a way we both could win

Goodbye Cathy

Goodbye

Goodbye
