Jamie is over and Jamie is gone
Jamie's decided it's time to move on
Jamie has new dreams he's building upon
And I'm still hurting

Jamie arrived at the end of the line
Jamie's convinced that the problems are mine
Jamie is probably feeling just fine
And I'm still hurting

What about lies, Jamie?
What about things
That you swore to be true?
What about you, Jamie?
What about you?

Jamie is sure something wonderful died
Jamie decides it's his right to decide
Jamie's got secrets he doesn't confide
And I'm still hurting

Go and hide and run away
Run away, run and find something better
Go and ride the sun away
Run away like it's simple
Like it's right...

Give me a day, Jamie
Bring back the lies
Hang them back on the wall
Maybe I'd see
How you could be
So certain that we
Had no chance at all

Jamie is over and where can I turn?
Covered with scars I did nothing to earn
Maybe there's somewhere a lesson to learn
But that wouldn't change the fact
That wouldn't speed the time
Once the foundation's cracked
And I'm
Still hurting

I guess I can't believe you really came
And that we're sitting on this pier
See, I'm smiling –
That means I'm happy that you're here

I stole this sweater from the costume shop -
It makes me look like Daisy Mae
See, we're laughing –
I think we're gonna be okay

I mean, we'll have to try a little harder
And bend things to and fro
To make this love as special
As it was five years ago
I mean, you made it to Ohio!
Who knows where else we can go?

I think you're really gonna like this show
I'm pretty sure it doesn't suck
See, you're laughing, and I'm smiling
By a river in Ohio
And you're mine…
We're doing fine

I think we both can see what could be better –
I'll own when I was wrong
With all we've had to go through
We'll end up twice as strong
And so we'll start again this weekend
And just keep rolling along…

I didn't know you had to go so soon
I thought we had a little time…
Look, whatever, if you have to
Then you have to, so whatever
It's all right –
We'll have tonight

You know what makes me crazy?
I'm sorry, can I say this?
You know what makes me nuts?
The fact that we could be together
Here together
Sharing our night, spending our time
And you are gonna choose someone else to be with - no, you are
Yes, Jamie, that's exactly what you're doing:
You could be here with me
Or be there with them -
As usual, guess which you pick!

No, Jamie, you do not have to go to another party -
With the same twenty jerks you already know
You could stay with your wife on her fucking birthday
And you could, God forbid, even see my show
And I know in your soul it must drive you crazy
That you won't get to play with your little girlfriends –
No I'm not, no I'm not! – and the point is, Jamie
That you can't spend a single day
That's not about
You and you and nothing but you
Mahvelous novelist, you!
Isn't he wonderful, just twenty-eight!
The savior of writing!
You and you and nothing but you –
Miles and piles of you
Pushing through windows and bursting through walls
En route to the sky!
And I…

I swear to God I'll never understand
How you can stand there, straight and tall
And see I'm crying
And not do anything at all…

One day we're just like
"Leave It to Beaver."
One day it's just a
Typical life
And then he's off on
A trip to Jamie-land:
Staring catatonic out the window
Barely even breathing all the while…

And then he'll smile
His eyes light up, and deep within the ground
Without a sound
A moment comes to life
And I'm a part of that
I'm a part of that
I'm a part of that

Next day it's just like
It never happened –
We're making dinners
We're making plans
Then he gets on the
Mule train to Jamie-land:
Handful after handful of Doritos
Circling the apartment, logging miles…

And then he smiles
His eyes light up, and how can I complain?
Yes, he's insane
But look what he can do
And I'm a part of that
I'm a part of that
I'm a part of that…

And it's true
I tend to follow in his stride
Instead of side by side
I take his cue
True, but there's no question, there's no doubt –
I said I'd stick it out
And follow through
And when I do –

Then he smiles
And where else can I go?
I didn't know
The rules do not apply
And then he smiles
And nothing else makes sense
While he invents
The world that's passing by
And I'm a part of that
I'm a part of that
I'm a part of that
Aren't I?

I'm a part of that
I'm a part of that
I'm a part of that

I could have a mansion on a hill,
I could lease a villa in Seville,
But it wouldn't be as nice as a summer in Ohio
With a gay midget named Karl playing Tevye and Porgy.

I could wander Paris after dark,
Take a carriage ride through Central Park,
But it wouldn't be as nice as a summer in Ohio
Where I'm sharing a room with a former stripper and her snake,
Wayne.

I could have a satchel full of dollar bills,
Cures for all the nation's ills,
Pills to make a lion purr,

I could be in line to be the British Queen,
Look like I was seventeen,
Still, I'm certain I'd prefer to be going slowly batty
Forty miles east of Cincinnati.

I could shove an ice pick in my eye,
I could eat some fish from last July,
But it wouldn't be as awful as a summer in Ohio
Without cable, hot water, Vietnamese food
Or you.

I saw your book at a Target in Kentucky
Under a sign that said, "New and Recommended."
I stole a look at your picture on the inside sleeve
And then I couldn't leave.
Richard, who was with me, got uncharacteristically quiet,
And he said, "All things considered, I guess you don't have to buy it."
So I smiled like Mona Lisa and I lay my Visa down.

He wants me, he wants me,
But he ain't gonna get me.
I've found my guiding light.
I tell the stars each night,

"Look at me,
Look at him,
Son of a bitch, I guess I'm doing something right!
I finally got something right!"

No, it's not Nirvana, but it's on the way.
I play Anita at the matinee.
Then I'll get on my knees and pray I can't state in my bio,
"I'm never gonna go back to Ohio"

I could chew on tinfoil for a spell,
I could get a root canal in hell,
But it wouldn't be as swell as this summer is gonna be.

'Cuz the torture is just exquisite,
While I'm waiting for you to visit.
So hurry up, Shmuck.
Get unstuck and get on the scene!

Love,
The midget,
The stripper,
Wayne the snake
And Mrs. Jamie Wellerstein!
That's me!

I am not always on time
Please don't expect that from me
I will be late
But if you can just wait
I will make it eventually

Not like it's in my control
Not like I'm proud of the fact
But anything other than being exactly on time
I can do

I don't know why people run
I don't know why things fall through
I don't know how anybody survives in this life
Without someone like you
I could protect and preserve
I could say no and goodbye
But why, Jamie, why?

I want to be your wife
I want to bear your child
I want to die
Knowing I
Had a long, full life in your arms
That I can do
Forever, with you

Til the world explodes
‘Til there's no one left
Who has ever known us apart!

Forever
Forever, Jamie…

There are so many years I need to be
With you…
I will never be alive...

I do

I do

I do

Is that one John Lennon?
That's the San Remo
Isn't that the Museum?
Can we go see the dinosaurs?

When you come home to me
I'll wear a sweeter smile
And hope that, for a while, you'll stay
When you come home to me
Your hand will touch my face
And banish any trace of gray
Soon, our love will rise anew
Even greater than the joy I felt
Just missing you
And once again, I'll be
So proud to call you "mine"
When finally you come home
To me

When you come home to me
I'll wear a sweeter smile
And hope that, for a while, you'll...
Okay, thank you
Thank you so much

I'm climbing uphill, Jamie
Climbing uphill

I'm up every morning at six
And standing in line
With two hundred girls
Who are younger and thinner than me
Who have already been to the gym

I'm waiting five hours in line
And watching the girls
Just coming and going
In dresses that look just like this
Till my number is finally called

When I walk in the room
There's a table of men
Always men - usually gay
Who've been sitting like I have
And listening all day
To two hundred girls
Belting as high as they can!

I am a good person
I'm an attractive person
I am a talented person
Grant me Grace!

When you come home...
I should have told them I was sick last week
They're gonna think this is the way I sing
Why is the pianist playing so loud?
Should I sing louder?
I'll sing louder
Maybe I should stop and start over
I'm gonna stop and start over
Why is the director staring at his crotch?
Why is that man staring at my resume?
Don't stare at my resume
I made up half of my resume
Look at me
Stop looking at that, look at me
No, not at my shoes
Don't look at my shoes
I hate these stupid shoes
Why did I pick these shoes?
Why did I pick this song?
Why did I pick this career?
Why does this pianist hate me?
If I don't get a callback
I can go to Crate & Barrel with Mom and buy a couch
Not that I want to spend a day with Mom
But Jamie needs space to write
Since I'm obviously such a horrible, annoying distraction to him
What's he gonna be like when we have kids?
And once again...
Why am I working so hard?
These are the people who cast Russell Crowe in a musical
Jesus Christ, I suck, I suck, I suck, I suck
When fin'lly you come home to...
Okay, thank you
Thank you so much

I will not be the girl stuck at home in the 'burbs
With the baby, the dog, and the garden of herbs
I will not be the girl in the sensible shoes
Pushing burgers and beer nuts and missing the clues
I will not be the girl who gets asked how it feels
To be trotting along at the genius' heels
I will not be the girl who requires a man to get by
And I

My best friend had a little situation
At the end of our senior year
And like a shot
She and Mitchell got married that summer
Carolann getting bigger ev'ry minute
Thinking, "What am I doing here?"
While Mitchell's out ev'ry night
Being a heavy-metal drummer
They got a little cute house
On a little cute street
With a crucifix on the door
Mitchell got a job at a record store in the mall
Just the typical facts of a typical life
In a town on the Eastern Shore
I thought about what I wanted
It wasn't like that at all
Made Carolann a cute baby sweater
Thinking, "I can do better than that"

In a year or so I moved to the city
Thinking, "What have I got to lose?"
Got a room, got a cat
And got twenty pounds thinner
Met a guy in a class I was taking
With some very well placed tattoos
He wouldn't leave me alone
'Less I went with him to dinner
And I guess he was cute
And I guess he was sweet
And I guess he was good in bed
I gave up my life for the better part of a year
So I'm starting to feel like this maybe might work
And the second it entered my head
He needed to take some time off
Focus on his "career"
He blew me off with a heartfelt letter
I thought, "I can do better than that"

You don't have to get a haircut
You don't have to change your shoes
You don't have to like Duran Duran
Just love me

You don't have to put the seat down
You don't have to watch the news
You don't have to learn to tango
You don't have to eat prosciutto
You don't have to change a thing
Just stay with me

I want you and you
And nothing but you
Miles and piles of you
Finally I'll have something worthwhile
To think of each morning
You and you
And nothing but you
No substitution will do
Nothing but fresh, undiluted and pure
Top of the line
And totally mine

I don't need any lifetime commitments
I don't need to get hitched tonight
I don't want you to throw up all your walls and defenses
I don't mean to put on any pressure
But I know when a thing is right
And I spend every day re-configuring my senses
When we get to my house
Take a look at that town
Take a look at how far I've gone

I will never go back
Never look back anymore
And it feels like my life led right to your side
And will keep me there from now on
Think about what you wanted
Think about what could be
Think about how I love you
Say you'll move in with me
Think of what's great about me and you
Think of the bullshit we've both been through
Think of what's past
Because we can do -
Better
We can do better
We can do better than that
We can do better than that

Don't kiss me goodbye again
Leave this night clean and quiet
You want the last word
You want me to laugh
But leave it for now

All you can say
All you can feel
Was wrapped up inside that one perfect kiss
Leave it at that:
I'll watch you turn the corner and go...

And goodbye until tomorrow
Goodbye until the next time you call
And I will be waiting
I will be waiting
Goodbye until tomorrow
Goodbye ‘til I recall how to breathe
And I have been waiting
I have been waiting for you

I stand on a precipice
I struggle to keep my balance
I open myself
I open myself one stitch at a time

Finally yes!
Finally now!
Finally something takes me away
Finally free!
Finally he can cut through these strings
And open my wings!

So goodbye until tomorrow!
Goodbye until my feet touch the floor
And I will be waiting
I will be waiting!
Goodbye until tomorrow!
Goodbye until the rest of my life
And I have been waiting
I have been waiting for you!
Waiting for you
Waiting for you!


Goodbye until tomorrow!
Goodbye until I crawl to your door
And I will be waiting
I will be waiting!

Goodbye until tomorrow!
Goodbye until I'm done thanking God
For I have been waiting!
I have been waiting for you!
I have been waiting!
I have been waiting for you!
I will keep waiting -
I will be waiting for you!

Just close the gate;
I'll stand and wait

Jamie

Goodbye
